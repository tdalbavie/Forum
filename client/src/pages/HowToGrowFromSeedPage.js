        <h2 className="grow-text">Materials Needed:</h2>
        <ul className="grow-list">
          <li>Ripe avocado</li>
          <li>Knife</li>
          <li>Toothpicks</li>
          <li>Glass or jar</li>
          <li>Potting soil</li>
          <li>Pot or container with drainage holes</li>
          <li>Watering can</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Step 1: Choose a Ripe Avocado</h2>
        <p>Select a ripe avocado. You can tell it's ripe if it yields slightly to gentle pressure.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 2: Remove the Seed</h2>
        <p>Carefully cut the avocado in half lengthwise, and then remove the seed from the center. Wash off any avocado flesh clinging to the seed.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 3: Prepare the Seed</h2>
        <p>Insert 3-4 toothpicks around the middle of the avocado seed, spaced evenly apart. These toothpicks will help suspend the seed in water.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 4: Suspend the Seed in Water</h2>
        <p>Place the seed, broad end down, in a glass or jar filled with water. The bottom inch or so of the seed should be submerged in water. Position the toothpicks on the rim of the glass or jar to keep the seed suspended.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 5: Change the Water Regularly</h2>
        <p>Change the water every few days to prevent mold and bacteria growth. Ensure the water level remains consistent, keeping the bottom of the seed submerged.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 6: Wait for Sprouting</h2>
        <p>Place the glass or jar in a warm, sunny spot, like a windowsill. It may take anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks for the seed to sprout. Be patient!</p>
        
        <h2>Step 7: Wait for Roots</h2>
        <p>Once the seed cracks and a root emerges from the bottom, wait for the root to grow to a few inches long before transplanting.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 8: Transplant the Seedling</h2>
        <p>When the root is a few inches long, carefully transplant the seedling into a pot filled with well-draining potting soil. Leave the top half of the seed exposed above the soil.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 9: Water and Care</h2>
        <p>Place the pot in a sunny location and water it regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Avocado trees prefer regular, deep watering.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 10: Provide Adequate Light and Temperature</h2>
        <p>Avocado trees need plenty of sunlight to thrive. Ensure they receive at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day. They also prefer temperatures between 60째F and 85째F (15째C to 29째C).</p>
        
        <h2>Step 11: Pruning and Maintenance</h2>
        <p>As the tree grows, you may need to prune it to encourage a bushier shape. Remove any dead or damaged branches and trim it to your desired size.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 12: Be Patient</h2>
        <p>Growing an avocado tree from a seed is a slow process. It may take several years for your tree to bear fruit, and even then, there's no guarantee it will produce avocados. However, the process itself can be rewarding and educational!</p>
        
        <p>By following these steps and providing proper care, you can grow your own avocado tree from a seed. Good luck!</p>
