# How to use (For Devs)
Ensure all dependencies are installed before running.
* Root directory:
* Run:

```
npm install
```
* Cd into server dir
* Run: 

```
npm install
```
*Cd into client dir
*Run:
```
npm install
```

Also, make sure to change the MONGODB_URI link to your own Atlas database, the current one is a placeholder to my own. 

* Wyatt Atlas, AllAboutAvocadosRecipe:
```
mongodb+srv://wyattbushman117:GOKZh0QIsmXRr1hs@recipecluster.5hx2wzz.mongodb.net/
```

To run, open two terminals in your code editor, one goes to the server folder and one to the client folder.

### Server
In the server terminal, to start the server, run the following command:
```
npm run server
```
### Client
In the client terminal, to start the client, run the following command:
```
npm start
```

### .env
Make a .env file in the root of the repo
```
touch .env
```

Add your URI to the .env file:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://wyattbushman117:GOKZh0QIsmXRr1hs@recipecluster.5hx2wzz.mongodb.net/
```

That should resolve any errors when running server


npm start on the client side will open up the home page. From here sign up some users, by default, these users are marked with the role `user` but can be changed to `admin` manually in the database, it should create a "test" database for you.

To change a user -> admin, simply change their object string from user to admin


Once you have created some users change one of the user's roles to `admin` for testing. Below is how your users should look in your database:

Ensure you are logged into the admin account that you have created (Note: passwords are encrypted so be sure to save it). 

To ensure you are correctly in an admin account, you should be able to make forum categories.

This will allow you to create Categories in the forum. When creating a Category it will ask for a name and description. After creation, a link is created to a new thread page which contains a default thread for the page generated by the system. In the threads page, both users and admins can now create threads but only admins can delete threads. Once you enter a thread a text box appears allowing you to make your posts. Users can only edit and delete their posts while admins can edit and delete anyone's post. For simplicity I let the admins be able to edit posts as a large amount of additions and checks would have to be added to do so.
